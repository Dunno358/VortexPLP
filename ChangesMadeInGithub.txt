[todo-DUNGEON] entering settings while on Tower Defense Lvls need to adjust allowing events(KEYDOWN) to queue
[todo-TD] change loading pounch sound at tower_defence to load once and play instead of when statement is true
[todo-TD] change damage to getting 1/3 of start hp(give start hp to another variable and use it)
[todo-TD] enemies and friends are moving too slow
[todo-TD] set possibility to not draw objects in reseting maps(problem when clicking menuBtb from StandardLessonEvents())
[IDEA] when user is not in admin mode make in place of changingLvl: line or bar with graphiccaly shown percentage of accomplishing course
[IDEA] Make funcktion that triggers all fucntions(shooting range, tower defense etc) out of event loop at main loop | less code space used in main loop
